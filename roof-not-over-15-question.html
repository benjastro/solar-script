        <p>
            A lot of times when roof damage is happening it is not visible due to the fact that usually its underlayment (tar paper) aging out and failing. Most of the older underlayment has a shelf life of about 10-15 years!
        </p>
        <h3>Offer no cost inspection</h3>
        <p>
            So, a lot of the time the damage is already happening and just not visible until you start to develop leaks and that is usually when the major damage is already done!
