        <h1>Solar</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Hello (clients name) this is (agents name) calling on behalf of Semper Solaris.
            <br><br><strong>Use your personality here</strong> – how are you today? How’s it going? Hope your having an awesome day!
            <br><br>We spoke a while back about your solar project, and I wanted to follow up to see if you have moved forward with it or if you’re still considering your options.
            <br><br><strong>IF WITH SOLAR - PROCEED</strong> 
            <br><br><strong>If NO Solar</strong> – Can I ask why you didn’t move forward with the project?
            <br><br>A lot of things have changed over the last few years and right now the Government is offering a 30% tax rebate for you to go solar and the great thing about it , it is no money out of pocket and no money upfront to install.  You owe it to yourself to have someone come out and see if they can save you money.  There has never been a better time than now to take advantage of the $$$$ savings 
        </p>
        <h2>Book appt</h2>
        <strong>Proceed with Question #3</strong>
        <p>
            I just have a few quick questions, and then I'll be on my way.
        </p>
        <h2>Screening</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Are you happy with the solar performance?
                <br><strong>IF YES</strong>– PROCEED to #2
                <br><strong>IF NO</strong> – May I know why you are not happy with your solar?
                <br>I'd love to have one of our Energy Experts conduct an analysis to determine if your system is providing the right energy offset. You might benefit from adding additional panels or a battery to improve efficiency. Would you be open to a free consultation?
                <br><strong>IF YES</strong> – PROCEED (Scheduled An Appointment with Date & Time)
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Do you have a Battery with that System?
                <br><strong>IF YES – PROCEED</strong>
                <br><strong>IF NO - Explain Battery Benefits & Offer Visits  ..Rep should deliver this</strong>
                <br>Storage technology is in high demand and a key element in Solar performance- It allows you to use your own energy when the Solar panels aren’t producing at night instead of pulling energy from the grid at a cost.
                <br><strong>Offer Visits-rep should say </strong>I can have one of my Energy Experts come out and do an energy analysis to show you the benefits of battery technology. Does this Date & time work for you?
                <br>
                <br><strong>IF YES – PROCEED (Scheduled an Appointment with Date & Time)</strong>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Is your roof over 15 years old?
                <br><strong>IF NO – PROCEED SCREENING #4</strong>
                <br><strong>IF YES -</strong> A lot of times when roof damage is happening it is not visible due to the fact that usually its underlayment (tar paper) aging out and failing. Most of the older underlayment has a shelf life of about 10-15 years!
                <br>
                <br><strong>(OFFER NO COST INSPECTION)</strong>
                <br>So, a lot of the time the damage is already happening and just not visible until you start to develop leaks and that is usually when the major damage is already done! We have Roofing specialists in your area doing no costs inspections to see if there is any early signs of damage and try to get in front of the high-cost repairs. . Does this Date & time work for you?
                <br>
                <br><strong>IF YES – PROCEED</strong> I can set an appointment to have them come by and see you

                I'm almost finished here, let me go through a list of some of the other services we are providing and see if you have a need for any of them as I have you on the phone, Is your HVAC properly maintained and running well?
                <br><strong>IF YES </strong> move on
                <br><strong>IF NO - PROCEED -</strong> WE can have someone out to inspect and see at no cost. . Does this Date & time work for you?

        <strong>(Scheduled an Appointment with Date & Time)</strong>
        <h3>Closing the call</h3>
        <p>
            If no appointments are booked “Thank you for your time! Have a great rest of your day."
        </p>
        <h3>If an appointment is booked</h3>
        <p>

        <h2 style="color: red;">Rebuttals</h2>
        <h3>
            This is the overall rebuttal to all no’s it gives you time to think of an answer
            <br>Feel felt and found 
        </h3>
        <p>
            I understand how you feel, other people felt the same way but what they found is <strong>(insert your answer here)</strong>
        </p>
        <h3>If they don't have solar</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Interest is fueled by performance – if you had solar for the last few years and were offsetting the increase in Energy rates year after year, you would have been putting extra money in your pockets and paying off other things than giving to the utility company</li>
            <li>More people are going solar today than every before in fact in California you cannot build a house without having solar on your roof as of this year!  It is not legal.  The demand is so high because it just makes sense.</li>
            <li>Right now the government is offering the 30% tax rebate, there is a chance that this could  go away, that is why you owe it to yourself to go solar now before its too late!!!</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>If they have solar and are not happy with it</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Solar is just math- either your using more electricity than your panels are producing or your using a lot of electricity at night without a battery back up – you owe it to yourself to have us do an analysis</li>
            <li>A lot of families grow overtime or just life schedules change would change your schedule and your energy usage , let us come out and see if your system is set up right for your lifestyle</li>
            <li>You have a solar system and obviously you spent a lot of money for it – let us see if it is performing at optimal level or if adding a battery or panels will really increase your cost savings – you owe it to yourself to have us come out</li>
        </ul>
