            Can I ask why you didn’t move forward with the project?
            <br><br>A lot of things have changed over the last few years and right now the Government is offering a 30% tax rebate for you to go solar and the great thing about it , it is no money out of pocket and no money upfront to install.  You owe it to yourself to have someone come out and see if they can save you money.  There has never been a better time than now to take advantage of the $$$$ savings
